# React useEffect Async State Update Race Condition

This repository demonstrates a common issue in React applications involving asynchronous operations within the `useEffect` hook and race conditions.  The bug arises from the possibility of the component unmounting before an asynchronous operation completes, potentially leading to errors or unexpected behavior.  The solution showcases a robust approach to handle such situations and prevent these issues.

## Bug Description
The component attempts to fetch user data asynchronously using `fetchUserData`.  If this fetch takes longer than the component's lifecycle, the `setUserInfo` might be called after the component is unmounted, triggering an error.  There is also a potential for multiple state updates, if `fetchUserData` is slow.
